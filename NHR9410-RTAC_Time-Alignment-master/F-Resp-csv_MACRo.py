# This file is meant to control NHR 9410 (Grid Simulator) frequency via SCPI Commands.
# An array of different values is used to accomplish this task.
# The equipment accepts values between 30-880 Hz.(Accodring to NHR 9400 Series AC/DC Power Module Programmerâ€™s Reference Manual)
# For each command below, a brief description is provided.
# This file is available to anyone who would like to use it. Feel free to copy,edit, and develop its content.

# As you read through this file, you'll find flags. These flags are not important. They were used just for learning purposes.

    s.send(output.encode('utf-8'))                                  # Each SCPI command MUST be encoded into utf-8.
    return s
def clos(s):                                                        # This function is meant to close the connection

    # The next block of the code is meant to send each frequency value that was read from "Aug_25.csv" file to the GS. (Take a look at the file!!)
    # Each command that is going to be sent goes through different network components (router,switch,etc). These components takes time to process each command. Hence, delay occurs.
    # Furthermore, the GS has two processors. The first one is used to translate the SCPI commands. The second one is used to execute the translated commands.
    # As more commands are sent to the GS, its processors take more time to execute the commands. Hence, time delay (x) is changed everytime.
    # After multiple testing processes, we figured out that the time delay (x) SHOULD be refreshed after 500 values.
    # You are MORE THAN WELCOME to try different approaches. If your approach works, YOU ARE A CHAMPION!
